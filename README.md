Ignition Physics, a component of [Ignition
Robotics](https://ignitionrobotics.org), provides an abstract physics interface
designed to support simulation and rapid development of robot applications.

# Motivation

Many physics simulation software libraries have been designed for different
applications (gaming, robotics, science) and with different features
(rigid or deformable contact, 2d or 3d).
Ignition Physics is designed on the premise that there is not a single physics
engine that is universally best for all simulation contexts.
It should be possible to support a different set of features
for each physics engine according to its capabilities.
A physics engine can then be chosen for each application
based on its context.

# Features

Ignition Physics provides the following functionality:

* Granular definition of physics engine features as optional API's.
* Plugin interface for loading physics engines with requested features
  at runtime.
* Features for common aspects of rigid body dynamic simulation
    - Construct model from SDFormat file.
    - Collision shapes (such as box, sphere, cylinder, mesh, heightmap).
    - Joint types (such as revolute, prismatic, fixed, ball, screw, universal).
    - Step simulation, get/set state, apply inputs.
* Reference implementation of physics plugin using
  [dartsim](http://dartsim.github.io/).
* CompositeData structures for efficiently using native types in API.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/physics/3.0/installation.html).

# Usage

Please refer to the [examples directory](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/raw/main/examples/).

# Documentation

API and tutorials can be found at [https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/physics](https://ignitionrobotics.org/libs/physics).

You can also generate the documentation from a clone of this repository by following these steps.

1. You will need Doxygen. On Ubuntu Doxygen can be installed using

    ```
    sudo apt-get install doxygen
    ```

2. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics -b main
    ```

3. Configure and build the documentation.

    ```
    cd ign-physics; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ../; make doc
    ```

4. View the documentation by running the following command from the build directory.

    ```
    firefox doxygen/html/index.html
    ```
