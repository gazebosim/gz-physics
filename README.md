Ignition Physics, a component of [Ignition
Robotics](https://ignitionrobotics.org), provides an abstract physics interface
designed to support simulation and rapid development of robot applications.

# Motivation

Many physics simulation software libraries have been designed for different
applications (gaming, robotics, science) and with different features
(rigid or deformable contact, 2d or 3d).
Ignition Physics is designed on the premise that there is not a single physics
engine that is universally best for all simulation contexts.
It should be possible to support a different set of features
for each physics engine according to its capabilities.
A physics engine can then be chosen for each application
based on its context.

# Features

Ignition Physics provides the following functionality:

* Granular definition of physics engine features as optional API's.
* Plugin interface for loading physics engines with requested features
  at runtime.
* Features for common aspects of rigid body dynamic simulation
    - Construct model from SDFormat file.
    - Collision shapes (such as box, sphere, cylinder, mesh, heightmap).
    - Joint types (such as revolute, prismatic, fixed, ball, screw, universal).
    - Step simulation, get/set state, apply inputs.
* Reference implementation of physics plugin using
  [dartsim](http://dartsim.github.io/).
* CompositeData structures for efficiently using native types in API.

# Install

We recommend following the [Binary Install](#binary-install) instructions to get up and running as quickly and painlessly as possible.

The [Source Install](#source-install) instructions should be used if you need the very latest software improvements, you need to modify the code, or you plan to make a contribution.

## Binary Install

On Ubuntu systems, `apt-get` can be used to install `ignition-physics2`:

```
sudo apt install libignition-physics2-dev
```

## Source Install

Source installation can be performed in UNIX systems by first installing the
necessary prerequisites followed by building from source.

### Prerequisites

Install required dependencies:

~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get -y install lsb-release
sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys D2486D2DD83DB69272AFE98867170598AF249743
sudo apt-add-repository -s "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable $(lsb_release -c -s) main"
sudo apt-get build-dep -y ignition-physics2
~~~

Use gcc-8:

~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get -y install g++-8
sudo update-alternatives --install \
  /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 \
  --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 \
  --slave /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-8
~~~

### Building from source

1. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics -b ign-physics2
    ```

2. Configure and build

    ```
    cd ign-physics; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
    ```

3. Optionally, install Ignition Physics

    ```
    sudo make install
    ```

# Usage
