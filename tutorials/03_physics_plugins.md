\page physicsplugin Understanding the Physics Plugin

This is an introduction to different physics engines and how they are integrated into the Ignition Physics library.

## Ignition Physics

The \ref ignition::physics "Ignition Physics" library integrates external physics engines into the Ignition eco-system.
It allows users to select from multiple supported physics engines based on their simulation needs.
Its plugin interface loads physics engines with requested features at runtime.
It is also possible to integrate your own selected physics engine by writing a compatible plugin interface.

To get a more in-depth understanding of how the physics plugin works in Ignition, we will start with some high level concepts and definitions.

<!-- TODO: add tutorial on how to write your own physics plugin -->

### High Level Concept

Conceptually, the physics plugin can be viewed from two sides of its interface: user vs. implementation.

Each physics engine provides access to different features implemented by the Ignition Physics engine.
The interface is made possible through the \ref ignition::plugin "Ignition Plugin" library, which instantiates \ref ignition::physics::Feature "Features" in \ref ignition::physics::FeatureList "FeatureLists" and supplies pointers to the selected engine.
This "user side interface" makes the Ignition Physics library "callable" from other Ignition libraries.

The implementation side interface handles specific implementations of each `Feature`.
Depending on what external physics engine we are using (DART, TPE etc.), the interface might be different.
This interface is more internal facing, i.e. used mostly inside the Ignition Physics library.

The implementation of the physics plugin revolves around four key elements.

1. \ref ignition::physics::Entity "Entity"

    This is the base class of all "proxy objects".
    The "proxy objects" are essentially interfaces into the actual objects which exist inside of the various physics engine implementations.
    The proxy objects contain the minimal amount of data (e.g. a unique identifier, a reference-counter for the implementation object, and a reference to the implementation interface that it needs) necessary to interface with the object inside of the implementation that it refers to.

2. \ref ignition::physics::FeaturePolicy "FeaturePolicy"

    FeaturePolicy is a "policy class" used to provide metadata to features about what kind of simulation engine they are going to be used in.
    Many physics simulations software libraries model 3-dimensional systems, though some (like Box2d) only consider 2-dimensional systems.
    A FeaturePolicy is used to customize Ignition Physics' APIs by the number of dimensions (2 or 3) and also the floating point scalar type (float or double).
    Dartsim and TPE reference implementations both use FeaturePolicy3d (3 dimensions, double).

3. \ref ignition::physics::Feature "Feature"

    This class defines the concept of a `Feature`, examples like `GetWorldFromEngine`, \ref ignition::physics::GetEngineInfo "GetEngineInfo" etc.
    There is a pre-defined list of features in Ignition Physics.
    They are implemented by using external physics engines' APIs to fulfill simulation needs requested by Ignition.

4. \ref ignition::physics::FeatureList "FeatureList"

    This is the class that aggregates a list of features.
    FeatureLists can be constructed in hierarchies, e.g. a `FeatureList` can be passed into another `FeatureList`, and the set of all features in the new list will be the sum.


### FeatureList Definitions

This list of `FeatureLists` is specific to the implementation of `Dartsim` and `TPE-plugin`.
Users do not need to organize their own plugin implementations this way.

| Name  | Definition  |
|---|---|
| Base  | contains data structures and functions that define and use "proxy objects"   |
| CustomFeatures  | retrieves `World` entity from physics engine|
| EntityManagementFeatures  | provides features to get, remove and construct entities  |
| FreeGroupFeatures  | finds free group entities and sets world pose, linear and angular velocities  |
| JointFeatures  | defines types of joints used and sets joint properties  |
| KinematicsFeatures  | computes frame relative to world  |
| LinkFeatures  | applies external force and torque to link  |
| SDFFeatures  | constructs entities from SDF file  |
| ShapeFeatures  | retrieves `Shape` related properties like `BoundingBox`, `ShapeSize` etc. |
| SimulationFeatures  | updates `World` and everything within by defined stepsize |

### Dart vs. TPE

<!-- TODO: add Bullet once it's supported -->
<!-- ### Bullet -->

Dart ([Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit](https://dartsim.github.io/)) is an open source library that provides data structures and algorithms for kinematic and dynamic applications in robotics and computer animation.
It is the default physics engine used in Ignition Simulation.
The source code for Dartsim plugin can be found in [Ignition Physics repository](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/tree/main) under `dartsim` directory.

TPE ([Trivial Physics Engine](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/tree/main/tpe)) is an open source library created by Open Robotics that enables fast, inexpensive kinematics simulation for entities at large scale.
It supports higher-order fleet dynamics without real physics (eg. gravity, force, constraint etc.) and multi-machine synchronization.
Ignition support for TPE targets [Citadel](https://ignitionrobotics.org/docs/citadel) and onward releases.
The source code for TPE plugin can be found in [Ignition Physics repository](https://github.com/ignitionrobotics/ign-physics/tree/main) under the `tpe/plugin` directory.

The following is a list of features supported by each physics engine to help users select one that fits their needs.
