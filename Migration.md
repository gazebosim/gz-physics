# Note on deprecations
A tick-tock release cycle allows easy migration to new software versions.
Obsolete code is marked as deprecated for one major release.
Deprecated code produces compile-time warnings. These warning serve as
notification to users that their code should be upgraded. The next major
release will remove the deprecated code.

## Gazebo Physics 5.X to 6.X

### Deprecations

1. The `ignition` namespace is deprecated and will be removed in future versions.  Use `gz` instead.

1. Header files under `ignition/...` are deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
   Use `gz/...` instead.

1. The shared libraries have `gz` where there used to be `ignition`.
  1. Using the un-migrated version is still possible due to tick-tocks, but will be removed in future versions.

1. The following `IGN_` / `IGNITION_` prefixed macros are deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
   Additionally, they will only be available when including the corresponding `ignition/...` header.
   Use the `GZ_` prefix instead.
   1. `IGN_PHYSICS_DECLARE_JOINT_TYPE`, `IGN_PHYSICS_DECLARE_SHAPE_TYPE`
   1. `IGN_PHYSICS_MAKE_ALL_TYPE_COMBOS`
   1. `IGN_PHYSICS_ADD_PLUGIN`
   1. `IGN_PLUGIN_REGISTER_MORE_TRANS_UNITS` -> `GZ_**PHYSICS**_REGISTER_MORE_TRANS_UNITS`
   1. `IGN_PHYSICS_REQUEST_FEATURES_MACRO`
   1. `IGN_PHYSICS_CREATE_SELECTOR`
   1. `IGNITION_PHYSICS_CONST_GET_ERROR` (hard-tocked, inside detail header)
   1. `IGNITION_UNITTEST_EXPECTDATA_ACCESS` (hard-tocked, inside test and detail headers)
   1. `IGNITION_PHYSICS_DEFINE_COORDINATE_SPACE` (hard-tocked, inside detail header)
1. The `ignition:expressed_in` SDF attribute is deprecated and will be removed.
   Please use `gz:expressed_in` instead.

### Breaking Changes

* The project name has been changed to use the `gz-` prefix, you **must** use the `gz` prefix!
  * This also means that any generated code that use the project name (e.g. CMake variables, in-source macros) would have to be migrated.
  * Some non-exhaustive examples of this include:
    * `GZ_<PROJECT>_<VISIBLE/HIDDEN>`
    * CMake `-config` files
    * Paths that depend on the project name
